This repository contains a collection of labs from the Software Testing module in my third year of Computer Science at TU Dublin.

# Lab Summaries

Each lab covers different testing methodologies and techniques, including unit testing, test-driven development (TDD), system testing, and business requirements validation.

## **Lab 1: The Language of Software Testing**

Lab 1 focuses on understanding the fundamental concepts of software testing, including errors, defects, failures, and root causes. It introduces the psychological aspects of testing and emphasizes the importance of thorough testing to prevent software failures.

### **Key Topics Covered:**
- **Errors, Defects, and Failures:** Case studies like the Mariner 1 Disaster and Image Upload Disaster.
- **Lecture 1 Review:** Understanding the need for testing and what makes a good tester.
- **Stormboard Activity:** Creating a mind map for different testing concepts.

## **Lab 2: Testing Throughout the Software Development Lifecycle**

Lab 2 explores how testing integrates into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), focusing on the V-Model. It introduces requirements modeling, acceptance testing, and system design.

### **Key Topics Covered:**
- **Business Requirements Modeling:** Extracting requirements from client communication.
- **Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Designing tests to validate system functionality.
- **System Design & Testing:** Defining system architecture and implementing unit tests.

### **Technologies & Tools Used:**
- Python unittest framework for system testing.
- YouTrack for bug tracking and test management.

## **Lab 3: Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)**

Lab 3 focuses on unit testing and test-driven development (TDD). It introduces writing unit tests for defect detection, business requirements validation, and implementing a game using TDD.

### **Key Topics Covered:**
- **Unit Testing for Defect Detection:** Testing and fixing bugs in the `Rectangle` class.
- **Business Requirements-Based Testing:** Validating the `Calculator` class functionality.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Implementing a Wordle game by writing tests first.
- **Unit Test Execution Proof:** Running tests in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

### **Technologies & Tools Used:**
- Python unittest framework for unit testing.
- VS Code for development.
